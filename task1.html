        <h1>
            what is Internet?
        </h1>
        <p>The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other using standardized protocols (mainly TCP/IP). It allows users around the world to access and share information, communicate via email or messaging, browse websites, stream media, use apps, and much more.</p>
        <p>Example:<br>
            You open your web browser and type www.google.com.<br>
            
            Your computer sends a request over the Internet to Google's servers.<br>
            
            Google’s servers receive your request and send back the homepage data.<br>
            
            Your browser displays the Google homepage</p>
    </div>

        <h1>
            what is browser?  
        </h1>
        <p>A web browser is a software application that allows you to access, retrieve, and view information on the World Wide Web. It acts as a bridge between you (the user) and the vast content available on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Example:<br>When you type a web address (URL) into the browser's address bar—like https://www.google.com—the browser connects to that website’s server and displays its content on your screen in a user-friendly format
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>what is URL?</h1>
        <p>A URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is the address of a resource on the Internet—like a specific web page, image, video, or file.</p>
        <p>Think of it as the digital version of a home address. Just like your home address tells people where you live, a URL tells web browsers where to find a specific resource online.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What is HTTP and HTTPS?</h1>
        <h2>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)</h2>
        <p>
            HTTP is the foundational protocol used for transmitting data across the internet. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between a web server and a browser, enabling the browser to request data (like web pages) from the server
        </p>
        <p>Common Usage: HTTP is commonly used for non-sensitive browsing, where privacy is not a concern (e.g., accessing public websites or informational pages).</p>
        <h2>HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)</h2>
        <p>HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption to protect the data being transmitted between the server and the browser. This ensures that any data (such as login credentials or payment information) is encrypted and cannot be intercepted or tampered with by unauthorized parties.</p>
        <p>Common Usage: HTTPS is used for secure transactions, such as online banking, shopping, and any site requiring user authentication (login pages, password resets, etc.).</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>what is IP address?</h1>
        <p>An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network, such as the Internet or a local network. It allows devices to communicate with each other by identifying and locating them on the network. The IP address works like a postal address, guiding data packets to the correct destination</p>
        <p>An IP address is a unique identifier for devices on a network, like 192.168.1.1. It helps route data between devices, such as when you visit a website, and the request is sent to the server’s IP address.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>what is Domain?</h1>
        <p>A domain is a human-readable address used to identify a website or a network on the Internet. It makes it easier for users to access websites without remembering complex IP addresses.</p>
        <p>Example:<br>
            www.example.com is a domain name, where:<br>
            
            "example" is the unique name,<br>
            
            ".com" is the top-level domain (TLD), indicating the type of organization or country.</p>
